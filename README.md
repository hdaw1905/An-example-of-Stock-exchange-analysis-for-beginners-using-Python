# An-example-of-Stock-exchange-analysis-for-beginners-using-Python
The weekly rates of return for five stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange are given in the file Stocks.dat. Call these stock column vectors: A, B, C, D, and E. we will approximate the joint distribution of the pair of stocks. Then we will find the covariance and correlation between each pair of stocks using the approximated probability distribution functions (pdfs) and directly over the data (sample covariance) too. The idea is to find out which two stocks have the highest correlation and how to use this information for investment.
